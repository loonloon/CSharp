Interface | Scenario
-- | --
IEnumerable, IEnumerable<T> | The only thing you want is to iterate over the elements in a collection. You only need read-only access to that collection.
ICollection, ICollection<T> | You want to modify the collection or you care about its size.
IList, IList<T> | You want to modify the collection and you care about the ordering and / or positioning of the elements in the collection.
List, List<T> | Since in object oriented design you want toÂ depend on abstractions instead of implementations, you should never have a member of your own implementations with the concrete type List/List.
