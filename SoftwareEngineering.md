#### Continuous Delivery ####
* Continuous delivery (CD or CDE) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.
* It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. 
* The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. 
* A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.



#### Continuous Deployment ####
Continuous deployment (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments.
